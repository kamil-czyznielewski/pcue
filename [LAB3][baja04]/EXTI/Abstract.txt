The 'ExtInt' project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 400 MHz
   - CCLK  = 100 MHz

 - Pin P2.10 is configured to generate an external interrupt.
   Pressing button INT0 toggles LEDs.
 

The EXTI program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:     configured for software Simulator

  LPC1768 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  LPC1768 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
